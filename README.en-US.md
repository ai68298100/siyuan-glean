> Turn the clippings already saved in SiYuan into a library you can confirm, triage, read, and review.

Lv Glean organizes clippings and articles already in SiYuan. It does not crawl the web, and ordinary notes are never captured just because they sit in a selected notebook. You review the source evidence and confirm each candidate before it enters the library.

## Latest update (main, based on v1.2.0, 2026-10-08)

Added: reliable recovery and reading workflows

- Inbox migration, external imports, backup/restore, and flashcard creation now keep exact checkpoints with bounded recovery and retry paths.
- Added reading position, real reading minutes, the library highlights wall, weekly/monthly/yearly reviews, author views, batch AI, formatting drafts, the external bridge, and AV projection.

Added: cross-surface entry points

- Desktop Workbench, standalone popup, and the mobile home view now expose the main capture, search, and candidate actions.

Improved: desktop and narrow-screen interaction

- Unified Chinese and English copy, accessibility semantics, and mobile touch targets; wide-canvas Today's Gleaning cards now align at the bottom.

Fixed: flashcard recovery and popup layout

- When a flashcard insertion response is lost, the plugin first recovers the exact checkpoint, then validates source-block ownership; invalid ownership still returns `sourceChanged` without inserting again.
- Fixed horizontal collapse in the standalone and settings popups, which caused one-character-per-line text, squeezed buttons, and accidental narrow-layout rules.

## Install and get started

Compatible with SiYuan `v3.8.5+`. Download `package.zip` from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/ai68298100/siyuan-glean/releases/latest), then install and enable the plugin in SiYuan.

1. In plugin settings, select one or more clipping notebooks for your library.
2. Open the library and choose **Organize clippings**. Start with the report preview, which makes no writes.
3. Review the source evidence for each candidate. Confirm it, add a source URL, keep it as a local document, or exclude a false positive.
4. Triage items into Inbox, Read later, Reading, or Archived. Explicitly choose **Mark as done** when you finish an article.

Ordinary notes are not bulk-captured just because of their location, and opening an article does not mark it as done.

## What you can do

- **Build a trusted library**: find candidates from source evidence, preview before confirmation, migrate existing clippings, filter, sort, and triage in batches.
- **Read by content type**: distinguish full-text clippings, link-only items, and local documents. Dock, Workbench, and Kanban share the same article state. Start reading and Mark as done are separate actions.
- **Resurface and review**: Today's Gleaning explains why an item returned; weekly, monthly, and yearly reviews can produce reports and CSV files.
- **Add capabilities as needed**: the reader tab (experimental and off by default), highlights, formatting drafts, AI, imports, snapshots, the SiYuan inbox, and plugin bridges have separate prerequisites. See the [capability matrix](docs/CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md).

## Data and privacy

- SiYuan document attributes are the source of truth for article state and metadata; the plugin index can be rebuilt. Uninstalling the plugin does not actively remove article attributes.
- Automatic processing protects existing source URLs, status, priority, rating, and author values. Explicit edits update only their selected fields.
- The plugin does not provide RSS crawling, cloud-account sync, or automatic reading, and it ships no model API key.
- AI features can be disabled individually. They are manual-only by default and require a configured model or channel. When used, article text is sent to the service you configured. Review the privacy terms of a custom endpoint. AI failures or quota limits do not block the core library.

## Compatibility and acceptance

The current stable release is [v1.2.0](https://github.com/ai68298100/siyuan-glean/releases/tag/v1.2.0). Its automated gates and isolated S1 service E2E have passed; this does not mean every real environment has been accepted.

Desktop host, Android/mobile, browser frontend, real models, the official clipper, external files, and subscription services still require environment-specific checks. Prerequisites, fallbacks, and open blockers are listed in the [capability matrix](docs/CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md) and [known blockers](docs/BLOCKERS.md). Unit tests and isolated E2E are not device acceptance.
